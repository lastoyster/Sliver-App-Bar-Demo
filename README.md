Sliver app bar offers custom scrolling behavior for app bars, allowing them to disappear while scrolling down and reappear when scrolling up.
Sliver app bars can be made scrollable by adding content underneath them using a SliverToBoxAdapter, ensuring proper scrolling behavior.
Properties like floating and pinned can be set to control when the sliver app bar appears or stays fixed during scrolling.
Advanced features like integrating a tab bar within the sliver app bar and creating custom overlays on top of the app bar are also demonstrated.
